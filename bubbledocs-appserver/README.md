# Bubble Docs Application Server

The **BubbleDocs** application's main goal is to support the creation, management, edition of various types of documents: spreadsheets, text and presentation. The users can interact amongst themselves through the edition of permissions to access specific files. Every user is identified by his username and password, which are an exclusive pair, and has permissions to read and/or write documents.
